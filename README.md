# Headphone Amplifier Project

This project involved designing and building a headphone amplifier from scratch.  
The PCB was designed using KiCad, and the circuit was analyzed in LTspice for performance verification.

## Project Contents

- Presentation and analysis in LTspice (in Polish): `/docs/presentation_pl.pdf`  
- PCB Gerber files for manufacturing: `/pcb/`  
- Photos of the assembled hardware: (coming soon in `/photos/`)

## Tools & Technologies

- KiCad (PCB design)  
- LTspice (circuit simulation and analysis)  
- Soldering and testing with multimeter, oscilloscope, power supply
